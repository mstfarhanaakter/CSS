        <b>Elemental (2023)</b>
        <p>Did you ever think you'd see a movie where the four elements of the world would come to life? Well, Disney
            and Pixar managed to do so, telling a heartwarming story of what happens when fire and water come together
            when it seems like opposites would forever attract.</p>

        <p>The well-loved popular video game characters get their own animated movie, following Mario and Luigi in an
            origin story of how they found themselves in a fantasy world. With Princess Peach and Toad by their side,
            the duo must find a way to fight for the Mushroom Kingdom, with the evil Bowser as their enemy.</p>

        <b>The Bad Guys</b>
        <p>Some folks just have bad reputations, like wolves, spiders, sharks, carnivorous fish and snakes. But when a
            group of these "Bad Guys" have to try and walk the straight and narrow, they find it feels pretty good —
            except when others can't get over their preconceived notions. Sam Rockwell gives a winning vocal performance
            as Wolf, the leader of the pack.</p>

        <b>The Sea Beast (2022)</b>
        <p>A world-famous monster hunter and an orphan of no renown are an unlikely pair in this sea-faring adventure.
            Maisie Brumble, the orphan, stows away on the ship of the famous Jacob Holland, hoping to help him destroy
            monsters. Instead, they learn that the world isn't what they expected. The movie is from the director of
            Moana, so he's had plenty of practice directing a story that traverses oceans.</p>

        <b>Turning Red (2022)</b>
        <p>Throw this movie on when you're just not seeing eye-to-eye with your kids, and you'll all relate to the story
            of kids who find their own ways around parental expectations. Only the main character, Mei Ling, does this
            in an unusual way, since her and her mother have to find a solution to her unusual affliction: She turns
            into a giant red panda whenever she feels extreme emotions.</p>

        <b>Wendell & Wild (2022)</b>
        <p>For something a little darker, there's this story, about two demons who try to trick a loner girl named Kat
            into helping them return to the land of the living. The movie is a team-up of stop-motion animation master
            Henry Selick <i>(The Nightmare Before Christmas)</i> and horror icon Jordan Peele <i>(Nope)</i>i, and both of
                their sensibilities come through in surprising ways.</p>

        <b>Encanto (2021)</b>
        <p>Most Disney movies feature a princess, or a hero on an epic quest to faraway lands. Encanto turns all those
            conventions on their head — Mirabel is not only not a princess, she's just a normal, not-gifted girl, and
            all the action takes place within walking distance of her house. And yet, she still gets involved in
            unraveling a mystery and learning truths about her family in unexpectedly exciting and emotionally involving
            ways. (Plus, this one has <b><u>"We Don't Talk About Bruno</u></b>," an all-time Disney banger.)</p>
